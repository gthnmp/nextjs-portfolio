Taking inspiration from the elegant design of canals-amsterdam.com, a website dedicated to Amsterdam's canals history, I was immediately astonished and thought, \"This design is truly amazing, how about I make my own about Jakarta?.\" Motivated by this inspiration, I tried to recreate a similar aesthetic for the Jakarta history website, striving to capture the essence of both cities while delivering an engaging user experience."
